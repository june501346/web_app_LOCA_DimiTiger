That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.\n\n```js\nfixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'\nfixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '\nfixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'\n```\n\n#### `ifElse`\n\n```ts\nifElse(\n  condition: Condition,\n  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,\n  elseFragment: string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n\ntype ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;\ntype Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);\n```\n\nChange the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.\n\n```js\nlet condition = getConditionValue()\nifElse(\n  () => condition,\n  color('red', 'ERROR'),\n  color('yellow', 'WARNING')\n)\n```\n\n#### `provide`\n\n```ts\nprovide<T>(\n  value: T,\n  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment\n): IFragment\n```\n\nProvides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.\n\n```js\nprovide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {\n  switch (value.level) {\n    case 'error':\n      return container(\n        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    case 'info':\n      return container(\n        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),\n        pad(2),\n        value.log\n      );\n    default:\n      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n<!-- badges (common) -->\n\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[prs-welcome-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[prs-welcome]: http://makeapullrequest.com\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/zamotany/ansi-fragments/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA&logo=discord\n[chat]: https://discord.gg/zwR2Cdh\n\n[version]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ansi-fragments.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-fragments",

Because Babel 7\nwill be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have\nno way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\ncannot change to\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"@babel/core\": \"6.x\"\n}\n```\n\nwithout it being a breaking change.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do\n\n\n```js\npeerDependencies: {\n  \"babel-core\": \"6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge\"\n}\n```\n\nthen where users of this package would originally have done\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core\n```\n\nto install Babel 6, they could now do\n\n\n```sh\nnpm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core\n```\n\nto install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.",

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

    "licenseText": "# BSER Binary Serialization\n\nBSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.\nBSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of\nencoded values.\n\nIt is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary\nwith no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating\nsystem filename storage.\n\nFor more details about the serialization scheme see\n[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar bser = require('bser');\n```\n\n### bser.loadFromBuffer\n\nThe is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,\ndecodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```",

Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

    "licenseText": "denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)\n=========\n\nTool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).\n\nInspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).\n\nWarning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.",

It works by splitting up the `no-unused-vars` rule depending on it being an import statement in the AST and providing an autofix rule to remove the nodes if they are imports. This plugin composes the rule `no-unused-vars` of either the typescript or js plugin so be aware that the other plugins needs to be installed and reporting correctly for this to do so.\n\n## _Important for version 1.1_\n\nThe `-ts` rules are deprecated, the package now looks for `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` to exist to decide between the typescript and eslint version.\nThe `-ts` rule will still work, but point to the new rule instead.\n\n## Typescript\n\nIf running typescript with [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) make sure to use both `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser`.\n\n## React\n\nIf writing react code you need to install `eslint-plugin-react` and enable the two rules `react/jsx-uses-react` and `react/jsx-uses-vars`. Otherwise all imports for components will be reported unused.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org) (and [@typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) if using typescript):\n\n```bash\nnpm i eslint --save-dev\n```\n\nNext, install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install eslint-plugin-unused-imports --save-dev\n```\n\n**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` globally.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `unused-imports` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"plugins\": [\"unused-imports\"]\n}\n```\n\nThen configure the rules you want to use under the rules section. I can recommend adding a check for underscores, e.g.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"rules\": {\n\t\t\"no-unused-vars\": \"off\", // or \"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": \"off\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-imports\": \"error\",\n\t\t\"unused-imports/no-unused-vars\": [\n\t\t\t\"warn\",\n\t\t\t{ \"vars\": \"all\", \"varsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\", \"args\": \"after-used\", \"argsIgnorePattern\": \"^_\" }\n\t\t]\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Supported Rules\n\n- `no-unused-imports`\n- `no-unused-vars`",

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

To use in node you can just do\n\n```JavaScript\nrequire('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\nTo use in the browser, you can add\n\n```HTML\n<script src=\"flow_parser.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich will make the `flow` object available to use like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nflow.parse('1+1', {});\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object.

    "licenseText": "# Growly #\n\nSimple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.\n\n## Installation ##\n\nInstall growly using `npm`:\n\n```\nnpm install growly\n```\n\nAnd then require it:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n```\n\nThis module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.\n\n## Example ##\n\nSending a minimal Growl notification:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n\ngrowly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the *example/* directory.\n\n## Usage ##\n\nThe growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.\n\n### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###\n\nRegisters a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.\n\n  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)\n  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.\n  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:\n    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)\n    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)\n    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)\n  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\ngrowly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [\n    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },\n    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }\n], function(err) {\n    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###\n\nSends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.\n\n  - `text` the body of the notification.\n  - `opts` an object with the following properties:\n    - `.title` title of the notification.\n    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.\n    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)\n    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)\n    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).\n    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.\n  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\n/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */\ngrowly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {\n    console.log('Action:', action);\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###\n\nSet the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseFile": "/Users/jaykim/Documents/JS/LOCA/APP/node_modules/imurmurhash/README.md",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The default resolver will already use PnP.\n\nSimply add the resolver to your configuration. For example, a minimal `jest.config.js` would be as such:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolver: require.resolve(`jest-pnp-resolver`)\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# metro-react-native-babel-preset\n\nBabel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.\n\nIf you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.\n\n## Usage\n\nAs mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:\n\nwith `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev\n```\n\nor with `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset\n```\n\n### Configuring Babel\n\nThen, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"module:metro-react-native-babel-preset\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If you're looking for the Electron app you can run, **use `react-devtools` package instead.**\n\n## API\n\n### `react-devtools-core`\n\nThis is similar requiring the `react-devtools` package, but provides several configurable options. Unlike `react-devtools`, requiring `react-devtools-core` doesn't connect immediately but instead exports a function:\n\n```js\nconst { connectToDevTools } = require(\"react-devtools-core\");\nconnectToDevTools(config);\n```\n\nRun `connectToDevTools()` in the same context as React to set up a connection to DevTools.  \nBe sure to run this function *before* importing e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`.\n\nThe `config` object may contain:\n* `host: string` (defaults to \"localhost\") - Websocket will connect to this host.\n* `port: number` (defaults to `8097`) - Websocket will connect to this port.\n* `useHttps: boolean` (defaults to `false`) - Websocket should use a secure protocol (wss).\n* `websocket: Websocket` - Custom websocket to use. Overrides `host` and `port` settings if provided.\n* `resolveRNStyle: (style: number) => ?Object` - Used by the React Native style plug-in.\n* `retryConnectionDelay: number` (defaults to `2000`) - Milliseconds delay to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection.\n* `isAppActive: () => boolean` - If provided, DevTools will poll this method and wait until it returns true before connecting to React.\n\n## `react-devtools-core/standalone`\n\nRenders the DevTools interface into a DOM node.\n\n```js\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port);\n```\n\nRenders DevTools interface into a DOM node over SSL using a custom host name (Default is localhost).\n\n```js\nconst host = 'dev.server.com';\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')\n};\n\n\nrequire(\"react-devtools-core/standalone\")\n  .setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById(\"container\"))\n  .setStatusListener(status => {\n    // This callback is optional...\n  })\n  .startServer(port, host, options);\n```\n\nReference the `react-devtools` package for a complete integration example.\n\n## Development\n\nWatch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:backend\n```\n\nWatch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:\n```sh\nyarn start:standalone\n```",

    "licenseText": "[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)\n\nsane\n----\n\nI've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.\nSane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:\n\n* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues\n* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms\n* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:\n  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)\n  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)\n  * polling\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## How to choose a mode\n\nDon't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane\nmaintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.\n\n* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode\n* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode\n* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`\n* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling\n* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\noptions:\n\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).\n* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.\n* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).\n* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\nIf you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).\nIf you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).\nFor the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).\n\n### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)\n\nThe watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:\n\n* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## CLI\n\nThis module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.\n\n```\nUsage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]\n\nOPTIONS:\n    --glob=<filePattern>\n      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n\n    --ignored=<filePattern>\n      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\n    --poll, -p\n      Use polling mode.\n\n    --watchman, -w\n      Use watchman (if available).\n\n    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>\n      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).\n\n    --dot, -d\n      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n\n    --wait=<seconds>\n      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled\n      after running <command>. Setting this option will\n      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.\n    --quiet, -q\n      Disables sane's console output\n\n    --changes-only, -o\n      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup\n```\n\nIt will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.\n\n### CLI example usage\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --wait=3`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' -p`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\nThe CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

    "licenseText": "# saxes\n\nA sax-style non-validating parser for XML.\n\nSaxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions\nof sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.\n\nDesigned with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the\nbrowser or other CommonJS implementations.\n\nSaxes does not support Node versions older than 10.\n\n## Notable Differences from Sax.\n\n* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML\n  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called \"strict mode\", is not strict. It\n  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need\n  better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.\n\n  Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes\n  will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to\n  extract data from malformed documents like sax does.\n\n* Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign\n  of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to\n  removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes\n  adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML\n  specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the\n  performance improvement.\n\n* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the\n  source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want\n  support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*\n  transpiled to ES5.\n\n* Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror\n  handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If\n  your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.\n\n* There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still\n  a \"streaming parser\" in the general sense that you write a character stream to\n  it.)\n\n* Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to\n  event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.\n\n## Conformance\n\nSaxes supports:\n\n* [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)\n* [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/)\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is\nwell-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs\nencountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of\nDTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be\nreported.\n\n## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`\n\nThe parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute\nvalues: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional\nentities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with\nthat. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the\ndoctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my\nguest.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief\nsummary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.\n\n**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**\n\nThe move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private,\nprotected, or public.\n\nIf you use anything not public, that's at your own peril.\n\nIf there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume,\nyou may assume incorrectly.\n\n## Summary Usage Information\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nvar saxes = require(\"./lib/saxes\"),\n  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();\n\nparser.on(\"error\", function (e) {\n  // an error happened.\n});\nparser.on(\"text\", function (t) {\n  // got some text.  t is the string of text.\n});\nparser.on(\"opentag\", function (node) {\n  // opened a tag.  node has \"name\" and \"attributes\"\n});\nparser.on(\"end\", function () {\n  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.\n});\n\nparser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name=\"world\">world</who>!</xml>').close();\n```\n\n### Constructor Arguments\n\nSettings supported:\n\n* `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default\n  is `false`.\n\n* `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is\n  treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only\n  results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position\n  information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if\n  this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize\n  execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag\n  causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.\n\n* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only\n  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.\n\n* `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is\n  `false`.\n\n* `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define\n   namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass\n   bindings for the namespaces `\"xml\"` or `\"xmlns\"`.\n\n* `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if\n  the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML\n  declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `\"1.0\"` or `\"1.1\"`. The\n  default is `\"1.0\"`.\n\n* `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML\n  version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag\n  is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the\n  default value of this flag is ``false``.\n\n  Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration\n  specifying XML version 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` without setting\n  ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of\n  ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to\n  ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be\n  parsed according to XML 1.0.\n\n### Methods\n\n`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to pass the whole document\nin one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write`\nwith each chunk.\n\n`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is\ndone processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.\n\n### Properties\n\nThe parser has the following properties:\n\n`line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the\nXML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property\ncounts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column`\nproperty counts Unicode characters.\n\n`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If\nit's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.\n\n`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.\n\n`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields\n`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before\nencountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML\ndeclaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no\nevent associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML\ndeclaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event\ngenerated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present\nat all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you\ncannot rely on the parser data!\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best\nto continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an\nerror, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance\n``<foo a=bc=\"d\"/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a=\"bc=d\"/>`` or\n``<foo a=\"b\" c=\"d\"/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to\nprovide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it\nreports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document\nthat saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.\n\nThat leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:\n\n* Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler\n  throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.\n\n* **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER\n  THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness\n  problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess\n  may be wrong.\n\n### Events\n\nTo listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events\nare also in the exported `EVENTS` array.\n\nSee the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported\nevent.\n\n### Parsing XML Fragments\n\nThe XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML\nfragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse\nfragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.\n\nIf you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser\nwill expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state\nequivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write(\"<foo\">)` had been called\nright after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is\nacceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that\nare inappropriate when parsing a fragment.\n\nThe option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI\nbindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if\nyou have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.\n\nThe option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if\nit is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over\n`additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined\nnamespaces is onerous.\n\nNote that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you\nwant. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.\n\nThe options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be\nused for parsing fragments. However, saxes won't prevent you from using them\nwith `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse\nwithout errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces\nwhich are not defined *in* the document.\n\nOf course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns`\nis `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there's\nno point in setting these options.\n\n### Performance Tips\n\n* saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\\u000A``) as end of line\n  markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\\r`` or\n  ``\\r\\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave\n  as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are\n  converted to ``\\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a\n  file in which all end of line characters are already ``\\u000A``.\n\n* Don't split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you\n  naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode\n  character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``\n  each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[0];\n  const b = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of\n  saxes prior to 4, you'd get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to\n  detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate\n  to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating\n  strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,\n  you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write\n  is fastest.)\n\n* Don't set event handlers you don't need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing\n  work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this\n  more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is\n  by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to\nevent handlers?\n\nA. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the\nsize of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text\nabove the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired\ninstead of a single event with a large chunk.\n\nHowever, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an\narbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a\nsingle instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause\nconflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different\npurposes.\n\nThese issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The\nbuffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split\n``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``,\n``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the\nlimit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the\npieces.\n\nIt was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent\nchunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the\ncase. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if\nyou passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K\nchunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can\ncontrol the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to\n``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data\nchunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has\njust finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write``\npasses 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated\nyet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks\nbuffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been\nprocessed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of\ndata. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you've set,\nyou may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've\nspecified.\n\nWe may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it\naddresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for\nuse-case scenarios that don't need it.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

To do an in-place\nsort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:\n\n```js\nconst arr = [10, 1, 5]\nstable(arr) === arr          // => false\nstable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true\n```\n\nA comparator function can be specified:\n\n```js\n// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.\n// This demonstrates the default behavior.\nconst lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)\nstable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']\n\n// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.\n// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.\nconst greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b\nstable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]\n```\n\n#### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar streamBuffers = require(\"stream-buffers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nWritable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tinitialSize: (100 * 1024),\t\t// start as 100 kilobytes.\r\n\tincrementAmount: (10 * 1024)\t// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE \t\t// (8 * 1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT\t// (8 * 1024)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting is standard Stream stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);\r\n// - or -\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nstreamBuffers.size();\t\t\t// 4.\r\nstreamBuffers.maxSize();\t\t// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t\t\t\t// Gets all held data as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\");\t\t// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);\t\t\t\t\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString(\"utf8\", 5);\t// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCare should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).\r\n \r\nDestroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"ASDF\");\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();\r\n\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();\t\t// Returns ASDF in Buffer.\r\nmyWritableStreamBuffer.write(\"Yeah?\");\t\t// No effect.\r\n```\t\r\n\r\n### Readable StreamBuffer\r\n\r\nReadable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. \r\n\r\nThe frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({\r\n\tfrequency: 10,\t\t// in milliseconds.\r\n\tchunkSize: 2048\t\t// in bytes.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault frequency and chunk size:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE \t\t// (1024)\r\nstreamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY\t\t\t// (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPutting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String\", \"utf8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\t// Yup.\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nChunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. \r\n\r\nsetEncoding() for streams is respected too:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding(\"utf8\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.on(\"data\", function(data) {\r\n\tassert.isTrue(data instanceof String);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. \r\n\r\nDestroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.put(\"A String!\");\r\nmyReadableStreamBuffer.size();\t\t\t// will be 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNot supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThanks to the following people for taking some time to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n * Igor Dralyuk <idralyuk@ebay.com>\r\n * Simon Koudijs <simon.koudijs@intellifi.nl>\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-stream-buffer is free and unencumbered public domain software.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If the condition is `true`, then it'll print a warning:\n\n```js\nconst warnOnce = require('warn-once');\n\n// ...\n\nwarnOnce(someCondition, 'This is a warning message');\n```\n\nYou can call `warnOnce` multiple times, but if the warning was printed already, it'll not be printed again.\n\nThe warning is only shown during development, i.e. if `NODE_ENV` is not set to `'production'`.",

    "licenseText": "# ws: a node.js websocket library\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws)\n\n`ws` is a simple to use WebSocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455,\nand [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js][archive].\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://websockets.github.com/ws\nfor the full reports.\n\n## Protocol support\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.\n  Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the\n  `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)\n\n### Installing\n\n```\nnpm install --save ws\n```\n\n### Opt-in for performance\n\nThere are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws`\nmodule. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as\nthey are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++\ncompiler is installed on the host system.\n\n- `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which\n  allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer\n  operations.\n- `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of\n  invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript\n  hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be\n  validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double\n  validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast\n  validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.\n\n### Sending and receiving text data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n  // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.\n  // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked.\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  var array = new Float32Array(5);\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n    array[i] = i / 2;\n  }\n\n  ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true });\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be\nmasked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text\ndata.\n\n### Server example\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### ExpressJS example\n\n```js\nvar server = require('http').createServer()\n  , url = require('url')\n  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })\n  , express = require('express')\n  , app = express()\n  , port = 4080;\n\napp.use(function (req, res) {\n  res.send({ msg: \"hello\" });\n});\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);\n  // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions\n  // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nserver.on('request', app);\nserver.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) });\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {\n  wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n    client.send(data);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional\n// callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has\n// actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function ack(error) {\n  // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,\n  // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that\n// since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be\n// captured when this technique is used.\ntry { ws.send('something'); }\ncatch (e) { /* handle error */ }\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {\n  protocolVersion: 8,\n  origin: 'http://websocket.org'\n});\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  console.log('connected');\n  ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\n\nws.on('close', function close() {\n  console.log('disconnected');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {\n  console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n\n  setTimeout(function timeout() {\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n  }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### Other examples\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the\nexamples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express\n2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n## API Docs\n\nSee [`/doc/ws.md`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## Changelog\n\nWe're using the GitHub [`releases`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases) for changelog entries.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[archive]: http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
